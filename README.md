## üîÆ The Project aims to ...

This project focuses on training and fine-tuning a Decision Tree Classifier to predict breast cancer outcomes as either positive or negative based on a diverse range of significant attributes.

 The dataset used for this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic), containing features for the prediction of the class : **Malignant(+ve)** or **Benign(-ve)**.


### **More about the work :**
---

A basic overview of breast cancer dataset is covered in [üìí**notebook-1**](https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-with-DecisionTree-Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/01-data-overview-breast-cancer-classification.ipynb). Simple plots to show distribution of features. 

Built a basic DecisionTree with default parameters and trained on the training dataset in [üìí**notebook-2**](https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-with-DecisionTree-Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/02-decision-tree-model-training.ipynb). 

The least important features found in the previous notebook are then reduced to n optimal dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (**PCA**) in [üìí**notebook-3**](https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-with-DecisionTree-Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/03-pca-feature-engineering.ipynb). The top n principal components having the highest eigenvalues are chosen for model training. A sample is shown below explaining data variance by top 3 eigenvectors.

 Further along, in [üìí**notebook-4**](https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-with-DecisionTree-Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/04-hyperparameter-tuning.ipynb), hyperparameters are tuned and optimal parameters are then used for the prediction. **RESULT**: *Individual hyper-parameter training show better results than GridSearch CV.* 

**Prediction performance of the tuned model:**

To understand how the tuned model works and how it is making predictions, in [üìí**notebook-5**](https://github.com/PragyanTiwari/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-with-DecisionTree-Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/05-tree-model-explainability_SHAP.ipynb), SHAP library is used for Model Interpretability. Global and 
The SHAP library is used to achieve Model Interpretability, enabling both global and local analyses of the optimized model's behavior. The **Decision Plot** below illustrates how individual features contribute to the prediction process, providing a clear understanding of the model's decision-making logic.
